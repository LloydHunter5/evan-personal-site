## Overview
This is a website I've started to build to showcase my programming skill and serve as a hub for future projects (especially web-based ones). I've tried quite a few frameworks and Svelte + Vite using Typescript has worked the best for me so far. The site also uses three.js to handle some of the graphics.

## Features
#### Current Features
* Neat little homepage
* Some pretty snazzy background art using Delaunay Triangulation (**WORK IN PROGRESS**, the algorithm is very bad with memory management at the moment)
#### Planned Features
* Project directory
* Navigation elements
* Links to github and other places to find me
